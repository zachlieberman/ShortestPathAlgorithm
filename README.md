# ShortestPathAlgorithm
Created Tolkienâ€™s MiddleEarth object with random seed generator that computes shortest distance from a random initial location back home with up to 10 different cities to visit. 

To Run:
1) Download the code or clone the repo
2) type "make" into command line
3) To run the main function type ./a.out <world_height> <world_width> <num_cities> <random_seed> <cities_to_visit> and add the necessary components with guidelines listed below:
  3a) for world_hight and world_width input the same number between 1-100
  3b) for num_cities input up to 40 cities
  3c) for random_seed input a random number
  3d) for cities_to_visit enter up to 10 cities to visit
